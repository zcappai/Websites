# Websites
This repository contains websites that I have coded using HTML and CSS, which I have learnt through the online platform, CodePen.

The websites include:
1. Survey Form - Allows information to be entered, such as name, email address, country of origin, programming languages, etc, which can then be submitted.
2. Tribute Page - Acts as an information page about the world-renowned actor, Marlon Brando.
